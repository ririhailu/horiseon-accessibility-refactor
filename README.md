# Horiseon-accessibility-refactor

## Description

The purpose of this assignment is to make changes to current site which will improve accessibility to variety clients and optimize the search engines. 

I learned different ways to manipulate the images and aligning multiple images to make sure they are within the border. It is important to have semetica HTML formate to give a clear and sharper context. Some of the div labels were changed to header, figure, article and aside accordingly.
